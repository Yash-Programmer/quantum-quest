# 🤖 How to Test Your Gemini AI Chatbot

Your Gemini AI integration is ready! Here's how to test it and make sure it's generating real AI responses instead of pre-generated ones.

## 🚀 Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Start the Server
**Option A - Double click:**
```
start_server.bat
```

**Option B - Command line:**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Yash\Downloads\quantum quest\finsight\backend"
C:/Users/Yash/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/python.exe simple_app.py
```

### Step 2: Test in Browser
Open: http://localhost:5000

You should see:
```json
{
  "service": "FinSight AI Chatbot",
  "gemini_status": "ready",
  "test_endpoint": "/test",
  "chat_endpoint": "/chat"
}
```

### Step 3: Test Gemini AI
Visit: http://localhost:5000/test

You should see a real AI response like:
```json
{
  "gemini_ready": true,
  "test_response": "Hello! Here's a quick budgeting tip: Track every expense for one week to understand your spending patterns - this simple step reveals where your money actually goes!",
  "message": "Gemini AI is working!"
}
```

### Step 4: Test Chat API
Run the test script:
```powershell
C:/Users/Yash/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/python.exe test_chat_api.py
```

## 🧪 Manual API Test

Use any API testing tool (Postman, curl, etc.) or this PowerShell command:

```powershell
$body = @{
    message = "I'm a student with $1000 monthly income. How should I budget?"
    context = @{
        monthly_income = 1000
        monthly_expenses = 800
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/chat" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

## ✅ What to Look For

**Signs of REAL AI responses:**
- ✅ Responses are unique and contextual
- ✅ Mentions your specific income/expenses
- ✅ Gives personalized advice
- ✅ Different responses to same question
- ✅ Natural, conversational tone

**Signs of pre-generated responses:**
- ❌ Same response every time
- ❌ Generic advice not related to context
- ❌ Responses seem templated
- ❌ No mention of your specific situation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Gemini AI not available"
1. Check your .env file has the correct API key
2. Verify internet connection
3. Try the quick test: `python quick_test.py`

### "Connection refused"
1. Make sure the server is running
2. Check if port 5000 is available
3. Try restarting the server

### Getting pre-generated responses
1. Check the server logs for errors
2. Verify API key is correct in .env file
3. Test direct Gemini connection: `python test_real_ai.py`

## 🎯 Integration with Flutter

Once your backend is working, your Flutter app can connect to:
- **Chat endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:5000/chat`
- **Test endpoint:** `GET http://localhost:5000/test`

The Flutter `GeminiChatbotService` is already configured to use these endpoints!

## 📊 Sample Conversation

**User:** "I have $1500 monthly income and $1200 expenses. Should I invest or save?"

**Gemini AI Response:**
```
Great question! With your $300 monthly surplus ($1500 income - $1200 expenses), I'd recommend a balanced approach:

1. **Emergency Fund First (Months 1-3)**: Save $200/month to build a $600-800 emergency fund
2. **Start Investing (Month 4+)**: Once you have that safety net, invest $150/month in low-cost index funds
3. **Keep Some Cash**: Save $50/month for short-term goals

Your 20% savings rate is excellent for someone your age! The key is automating these transfers right after you get paid.

This shows the AI is:
- ✅ Using your specific numbers ($1500, $1200, $300)
- ✅ Providing personalized advice
- ✅ Giving actionable steps
- ✅ Being conversational and encouraging
